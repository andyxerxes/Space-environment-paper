# Public Resources for Space Environment paper

This repository contains data files and plotting scripts connected with the article 
"The case for treating orbital space as part of the environment" by Lawrence et al 2021, 
published in Nature Astronomy.

This article has its origin in an "Amicus Brief" submitted to the US Court of Appeal 
in August 2021, in support of an appeal made by several organisations 
against a specific order made by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 
granting license amendments for SpaceX Starlink satellites, 
on the ground that such an order should have been subject to a 
full environmental assessment under US NEPA law. 
The final Amicus Brief was submitted by just one of the current authors (A.Lawrence) 
and is available [here](https://andyxlastro.me/losing-the-sky-resources/).
In fact the material used in its preparation was put together collaboratively 
by all of the authors of the Nature Astronomy article in a more straightforward 
scientific article fashion. This article is intended as a 
public version, with only minor changes from the August 2021 material.
